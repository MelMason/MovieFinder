## General info

The purpose of this project is to provide users with an opportunity to explore movie data and make movie selections based on various parameters. To do this, we munged data from [OMDb](http://www.omdbapi.com/) and [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US), and merged the data to SQLAlchemy. We then created an interactive quadrant chart, which displays movie selection based on user-chosen parameters. The user can then select a movie, and additional information about the movie is displayed on various graphs.
